# Industry
Code for taking a list of stocks and creating a new text file that includes their sectors and industries.

the main() can take a parameter called sort. By default it is turned off but if set to true it will generate the same text file except it will be sorted by the industry instead of alphebetical by stock ticker

I included some example text files it generated. Using a list of stocks under $5 with options. It created a txt file that includes their sectors and industry. As well as sorted version of that text file. 

See github.com/mlarocque22/stock_text_files for all the text files I have created with this
